## Processing Calculator
##### Completed Nov. 2018


This Processing project consists of an object oriented calculator with features including standard mathematical functions (addition, multiplication, etc.), trigonometric options (sin, cos, and tan), square root evaluation, and a percentage converter. Buttons automatically shade to indicate cursor movement, and a myriad of colors emerge prominent on a desktop.

## Processing Screensaver Application
##### Completed Oct. 2018


Another Processing creation, the object oriented screensaver utilizes random values to construct a tumultuous, vibrant picture, replete with sharp colors. X-shapes are drawn on a stagnant canvas (the browser's display), with continually altered dimensions, stroke weight, and color. The product epitomizes the innate chaos of order, frenetic shades in stagnant bodies.

## Processing Spaceship Game
##### Completed Dec. 2018


The most convoluted Processing contribution to this portfolio, the Spaceship Game is a side-scrolling mania of asteroids, lasers, gold, and fleets. A player is tasked with escaping an infinite quantum asteroid field, whilst simultaneously repairing their ships. If a rock surpasses the barricade of lasers posed by the user, health diminishes. Upon its striking zero, the infamous "Game Over" is displayed. The yellow objects hurtling toward the ships are the aforementioned "gold"; striking one will either generate a new ship, benefit chances of firing a laser, or increase health remaining. As time inexorably parades forth, so do respective levels in a series of magnifying difficulty. A field of stars, random shapes, malfunctioning lasers and a vibrant theme promote an extraterrestrial ambience in this perpetual battle against the elements.

## Python Date Application
##### Completed Feb. 2019


The date application provides a unique insight into one's existence, furnishing a product offering ample introspection. Inputting the year, month, day, and time of their birth, a user recieves the entirety of their lifespan, measured from seconds to millenia. Accuracy is in no fashion sacrificed for quantity; leap years, and all stipulations thence accompanying, are factored into the equation, and the present time is accessed via Python datetime and time modules.
