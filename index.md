## First Semester Processing Calculator
##### Completed Nov. 2018


This Processing project consists of an object oriented calculator with features including standard mathematical functions (addition, multiplication, etc.), trigonometric options (sin, cos, and tan), square root evaluation, and a percentage converter. Buttons automatically shade to indicate cursor movement, and a myriad of colors emerge prominent on a desktop.
