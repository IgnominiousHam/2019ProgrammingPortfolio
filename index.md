## Processing Calculator
##### Completed Nov. 2018


This Processing project consists of an object oriented calculator with features including standard mathematical functions (addition, multiplication, etc.), trigonometric options (sin, cos, and tan), square root evaluation, and a percentage converter. Buttons automatically shade to indicate cursor movement, and a myriad of colors emerge prominent on a desktop.

## Processing Screensaver Application
##### Completed Oct. 2018


Another Processing creation, the object oriented screensaver utilizes random values to construct a tumultuous, vibrant picture, replete with sharp colors. X-shapes are drawn on a stagnant canvas (the browser's display), with continually altered dimensions, stroke weight, and color. The product epitomizes the innate chaos of order, frenetic shades in stagnant bodies.

## Processing Spaceship Game
##### Completed Dec. 2018


The most convoluted Processing contribution to this portfolio, the Spaceship Game is a side-scrolling mania of asteroids, lasers, gold, and a fleet.
